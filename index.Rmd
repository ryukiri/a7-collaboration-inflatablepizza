There are a total of `r num.freshmen` freshmen, `r num.sophomores` sophomores, `r num.juniors` juniors, and `r num.seniors` seniors in the class. `r never.used.r`% of people in the class have never used R before, `r used.a.few.times.r`% of people in the class have used R a few times before, and `r intermediate.user.r`% are intermediate users of R. `r mac`% of people typically use Mac operating system, `r windows`% of people typically use Windows operating system, and `r other`% typically use a combination of systems or a different system.
